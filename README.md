# :pushpin: Mastermind - virtual code-breaking game :pushpin:  

A structure-oriented interactive app based on the classic code-breaking game.


## :pushpin: General Information
 
Become a codebreaker and try to win with a computer-generated opponent by guessing the password in less than ten attempts!  

*This is a copy of my first interactive game created [here](https://github.com/AgnieszkaAureliaMarczak/Podstawy/blob/master/src/metody/Mastermind.java). I designed it to practise mathematical algorithms and structured programming principles.*  


## :pushpin: How To Use
:point_right: Clone the repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), then run it on your computer
